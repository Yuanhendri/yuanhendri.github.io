         Hello, my name is Yuan and welcome  to my website! After attending 4 years of high school in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, I moved to Portsmouth, England where I spent 6 years and obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I have been a resident of the United State for almost 2 decades now and currently live in Tennessee. 

I think code is fun and I'm always passionate about coding.
